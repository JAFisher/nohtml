## NO HTML 

Say goodbye to poor ajax logic, say hello to your new best friend no html, is built to be an extendable javascript framework where modules can be added
in with rapid speed, destoryed memory mangament and mix in logic for express template design.

Would i say this is an mvc? no... i would say it a rapid module templating engine for JS apps.

What that mean in real terms? rapid development! small footprint.

### Logic, Containers, Modules & Storage 

#### Logic

All resources need to be loaded in by no html this can be done on the fly,
or in one big go it really up to you how you break up the resource loading.

class namespace:
nohtml - see documentation [here](myLib/README.md) | see examples[here]()

#### Containers

No Html leverages alot of templates and one of the most used templates will be
the containers. these containers allow you to hold module logic and also allow you
to put any sort of data in the page template itself.

class namespace:
nh_page - see documentation [here](myLib/README.md) | see examples [here]()

#### Modules

No Html backbone is it modules these templates are run at render times allowing you put
complex module logic places & then allow you to reuse them at later dates in other containers.

class namespace:
nh_list_view - see documentation [here](https://github.com/JAFisher/nohtml/blob/master/nh_list_view.md)

#### Storage

class namespace:
nh_data - see documentation [here](myLib/README.md) | see examples;

#### Upcoming Development Milestones

nh_page is needing a default UI revamp
nh_list_view is requires a horzionital verison with lazyload.

#### Shell

1) Quick Boilerplate through shell
2) Desktop Boilerplates through shell.
3) Mobile Boilerplates through shell.
